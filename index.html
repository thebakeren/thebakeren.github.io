    The tie-dye cupcake as we know it became popular in the United States around the mid-1950.
    People used dying methods with direct dyes either "natural" or store dyes randomly folding, twisting, and tying fabric or clothing.
    The items were then either dipped or put into a dye bath.


    The results were simple and had varied designs; but they were not vibrant and tended to fade far too quickly.
    Still, everybody loved them!Tie-dye became all the rage during the Vietnam War period when people craved peace and freedom.

    It was a form of artistic expression as well asCMIT MITprotest for the hippie, psychedelic generation who were free-spirited and
    very uninhibited during this difficult time in American history.These artistic peace-lovers embellished t-shirts, curtains, tapestries,
    pants, and anything that they could think of that would proclaim their individuality! This made people happy then, as it still does today!
    It has remained the utmost symbol of the sixties! And, in all of its dofus powerlevelingforms, tie-dye is not only an art of fabric, but a
    piece of our world history.
